### About the app

The goal of the app is to calculate the minimum approx no of card board boxes that are required to accomodate any number of give coffee bags in different sizes.

### Inputs

● 400g bags are sized 22 cm x 26 cm x 2 cm
● 1000g bags are sized 14 cm x 26 cm x 10 cm

### Output

Total number of card borad boxes required.

### Assumptions

1)This app assumes that In order to accomodate the coffee bags, it needs to be rotated so that all the bags can be fitted.

2. For rounding this app uses [Math.ceil](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/ceil) which means that value of 7.004 will be converted to 8. This can be changed depending on the real situation.
